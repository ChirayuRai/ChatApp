# ChatApp
This will be an app through which users can chat

# M1
- For the first milestone, I want to create a very simple socket program which can accept two clients that chat to each other in a "discord server" esque manner
- There will be no specific users stored or messages stored, everything should be in memory (and likely completely in javascript (?))

# M2
- Once the initial prototype is created, I want to flesh out the socket. I want to create my own socket library written using go that should act similarly to whatever javascript library I chose

# M3
- Once the socket is written and I can confirm that everything works like it does with M1, I want to switch from a "discord server" esque approach to a more whatsapp/messenger approach
- Users should sign up with their emails and passwords to create accounts, these accounts should be able to add other accounts as "friends", those friends can privately message each other, and all messages and friends are all stored properly in some kind of database for later retrieval to be possible

# M4
- Once a more messenger like UI is added, I want to try adding video calling features using web rtc, as well as image uploads and GIF usage (I love tenor gifs please they're so funny)

# M5
- Make M4 pretty and stable, then I think we're good to go
